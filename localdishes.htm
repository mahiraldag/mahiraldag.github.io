              <p> Malaysian cuisine consists of cooking traditions and practices found in Malaysia, and reflects the multiethnic makeup of its population. The vast majority of Malaysia's population can roughly be divided among three major ethnic groups: Malays, Chinese and Indians. The remainder consists of the indigenous peoples of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia, the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia, the Peranakan and Eurasian creole communities, as well as a significant number of foreign workers and expatriates. As a result of historical migrations, colonisation by foreign powers, and its geographical position within its wider home region, Malaysia's culinary style in the present day is primarily a melange of traditions from its Malay, Chinese, Indian, Indonesian and ethnic Bornean citizens, with heavy to light influences from Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, and British cuisines, to name a few. <br> <br>   This resulted in a symphony of flavours, making Malaysian cuisine highly complex and diverse. Because Peninsular Malaysia shares a common history with Singapore, it is common to find versions of the same dish across both sides of the border regardless of place of origin, such as laksa and chicken rice. Also because of their proximity, historic migrations and close ethnic and cultural kinship, Malaysia shares culinary ties with Indonesia, as both nations often share certain dishes, such as satay, rendang and sambal. <br> <br></p>

     <figure> <figcaption> When Minangkabau immigrants from Sumatra settled in “The Nine States” during the 15th Century, they brought with them much Indonesian influence. Nasi Padang, named after the capital of Sumatra, consists of rice eaten with spicy curries. Their Beef Rendang, made with chilli, santan (coconut milk) and galangal, a fragrant rhizome similar to ginger, is particularly famous. </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption> The town of Kajang, just 20km from Kuala Lumpur, is known as “Satay City” because of the reputation it has gained for the popular skewered meat. Even as you drive into the town centre, the pervasive aroma of barbequed meat will make you salivate. There are vendors at practically every street corner and food court, all busy fanning their charcoal braziers whilst vying for your patronage. </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption> With the high Malay population (90%) in this charming East Coast state and its long coastline, it figures that the food will be predominantly ethnic with lots of fish. Nasi Dagang is a reddish glutinous rice which is steamed with ordinary white rice, after which santan (coconut milk) and some spices are stirred in. This results in a rich and fragrant mixture which is served with various fish curries and pickles. </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption> Nasi kerabu is a fragrant rice meal eaten mostly in the east coast. Here in the west side you often find it during Ramadhan but unless you have a Kelantanese friend who doesn't mind cooking for you, it's not as commonly found as the more popular east coast import of nasi dagang.
      Basically it's rice eaten with ulam, serunding kelapa and sambal budu. Often there is telur masin and keropok on the side. Dishes eaten with it are such as solok cili, daging salai or ayam percik but it can easily remain vegetarian, just take out the budu from the sambal.  </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption> Pisang goreng or fried bananas ranks next to nasi goreng or fried rice as one of the most commonly sold dishes here. At nearly every street corner an itinerant fried snack vendor has it in his array of gorengan or fried food on display. Some people consider pisang goreng as their breakfast while for others it is just a snack or a solution to those late night munchies.  </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption>An extremely popular Peranakan dish in Southeast Asia, laksa is typically made with rich coconut milk based curry, assam based broth or even a perfect wed of the two variations. Over time, many have created and reinvented the laksa to their own preference and thus, variations such as the Laksa Johor, Singapore Katong Laksa and Sarawak Laksa amongst others were bred.  </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption> Nasi lemak is a Malay fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish it is also popular in neighbouring areas such as Singapore Brunei, and Southern Thailand. In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra; especially Malay realm of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan. Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao prepared by Filipino Moro. It is considered one of the most famous dishes for a Malay-style breakfast. It is not to be confused with nasi dagang, sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan, although both dishes are often served for breakfast. However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day. </figcaption></figure>

     <figure> <figcaption>Turmeric fried chicken is a delicacy of its own. Marinated with turmeric, it is fried until the meat is slightly dry. Most people wouldn't want to eat dried up fried chicken. Most people are not Malaysians. Turmeric fried chicken are usually found in Indian or Malay food stands. They are generally eaten with rice or with nasi lemak.  </figcaption></figure>
